# AnimationThrowdown helper

This is a command-line utility intended to help Animation Throwdown players to choose the best deck possible. 

- discover powerful combos you may have missed out.

- see which siege island suits you best

- find out which cards of yours are the most powerful

- check which combos are the strongest: 
    - in general 
    - for each card alone
    - for some skill you like the most

Currently this utility only shows various useful statistics for your active deck and all your cards. 
In future I plan to make it able to generate decks based on requested criteria 
(for example, deck with the strongest Punch, deck with the most American Dad cards, the most Drunk trait, most Clash combos, and such)


##### What is special about this tool? 

- works with _your_ deck: takes into account cards levels, combo mastery, duplicate cards - 
for both regular cards and combos. HP, Attack, Skills - everything will be exactly as you see in-game.


##### Usage

Requires Python 3
